Patent on- Appropriate ventilation for a building space while maintaining building comfort includes tracking one or more interior environmental conditions within the building space and one or more exterior environmental conditions outside of the building space during operation of the HVAC system. An environmental model for the building space is learned over time based at least in part on these tracked environmental conditions, where the environmental model predicts an environmental response of the building space to operation of the HVAC system under various interior and exterior environmental conditions. An appropriate ventilation rate that maintains adherence to one or more comfort parameters of the building space is determined by using the environmental model of the building space. The outdoor air ventilation damper of the HVAC system is controlled to provide appropriate ventilation.

## Work Experience
**Senior Data Scientist @ Honeywell (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- RAG Application Development for Equipment Manuals - Developed a RAG pipeline using Azure Document Intelligence for data extraction from equipment manuals. Experimented with open-source and OpenAI-based LLMs. Integrated Langchain for chat memory and Cohera for improved data retrieval. Evaluated performance using RAGA and TruEval techniques.
- Developed and deployed a machine learning-based [Linear Regression & Random forest] occupancy prediction model, utilizing a wide range of features including external weather data, building use, occupancy history, events, building systems, occupant characteristics, and sensor data. Achieved a MAE of 3 and continuously trained the model using MLOps techniques for improved accuracy. Deployed the model as a cloud-based API for easy integration with other systems.
- Identification of faulty equipment components based on diagnostic test data. Used diagnostic test data to identify equipment in a chemical plant that needs repair. Implemented a two-stage classifier, with the first stage classifying equipment into repair vs. no repair using Ensembled Classifier, and the second stage detecting the point of repair using a multi-label classifier.Achieved predictions that matched 96.8% of the time with the subject matter expert (SME).

**Data Scientist @ Thales (_August 2018 - August 2021_)**
- Unsupervised Anomaly Detection(AD) on Time-series Telco network data. Designed & Developed ARIMA, Fourier, FPgrowth based methods to extract independent anomalies and co-occurring sources of the problem from large-scale data.Reconciled anomalies & provided drill down to the root cause. Resulted in a reduction of alarms by 9%.
- Rule Mining to Explain reasons for Bad quality voice call --> Implemented decision tree rule mining technique to identify the feature combinations and value ranges that resulted in bad quality voice calls. The model was carefully tuned to avoid overfitting and the extracted rules were presented to the higher management for insights and resource planning.

US020220228756A120220721 - [Link](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c2/55/70/35bf9000eb1413/US20220228756A1.pdf)
Patent on- Appropriate ventilation for a building space while maintaining building comfort includes tracking one or more interior environmental conditions within the building space and one or more exterior environmental conditions outside of the building space during operation of the HVAC system. An environmental model for the building space is learned over time based at least in part on these tracked environmental conditions, where the environmental model predicts an environmental response of the building space to operation of the HVAC system under various interior and exterior environmental conditions. An appropriate ventilation rate that maintains adherence to one or more comfort parameters of the building space is determined by using the environmental model of the building space. The outdoor air ventilation damper of the HVAC system is controlled to provide appropriate ventilation.
